          <h2>Day 1</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my day’s off to a terrible start. My little brother is so annoying. He, like, woke me up at 3 a.m. 3 A.M!!! Now I’m being tortured by some bothersome people that are apparently my *family*. They keep on picking me up and petting me and tell me I’m a *good* girl. Ugh! I mean, what if I want to be bad? I was so furious, I found a felted snowman that one of them had made, and played with it and made it fall apart. I almost felt bad when she saw it and wailed in despair. Almost. The only place where I feel safe and peaceful is her brother’s room. He’s the only one that doesn’t really bother me. He also doesn’t walk around , and sigh and wail noisily for NO absolute reason. Just seeing that girl makes me shudder and cower in fright. Not just that, but she always wants to *pet*(A.K.A try to, and end up pulling my fur as I run away) me. She’s a cat’s worst nightmare.</p>

          <h2>Day 2</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Today was a tiny bit better than yesterday. But still, I wish I could live somewhere else in the evenings. The girl insists on pulling me under the blankets when I’m so clearly content on MY blanket. But no, I have to be dragged under the steaming hot blankets. It may be nice to them, but not to me! The girl is not the one with a built in fur coat. I’m like,”Excuse me! I was perfectly happy where I was, you know.” After I run away, she whines about how I don’t like her. I think,” Since when did I ever like you?” Then she becomes the center of attention and nobody cares about me.  That child is such a drama queen! The only good thing about her is she loves mischief, like me. Apparently I’m her partner in crime. My opinion is a bit different. I think,” You know, I think you’ve got the roles reversed. I’m clearly more important than you, worthless flabby, fleshy human. Cats are so amazing. Tight skin (except for our stomachs)☺☺ and nice fur so our outside touched part, isn’t sticky and gross.
