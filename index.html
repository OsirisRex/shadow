          <h2>Day 1</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my day’s off to a terrible start. My little brother is so annoying. He, like, woke me up at 3 a.m. 3 A.M!!! Now I’m being tortured by some bothersome people that are apparently my *family*. They keep on picking me up and petting me and tell me I’m a *good* girl. Ugh! I mean, what if I want to be bad? I was so furious, I found a felted snowman that one of them had made, and played with it and made it fall apart. I almost felt bad when she saw it, and wailed in despair. Almost. The only place where I feel safe and peaceful is her brother’s room. He’s the only one that doesn’t really bother me. He also doesn’t walk around , and sigh and wail noisily for NO absolute reason. Just seeing that girl makes me shudder and cower in fright. Not just that, but she always wants to *pet*(A.K.A try to, and end up pulling my fur as I run away) me. She’s a cat’s worst nightmare.</p>
